            <div class="index-section1-text">Rancho San Joaquin Middle Schoolâ€™s NJHS program was proudly established in the 2021-22 school year. Each year, we select eighth grade students that display the pillars of NJHS: Scholarship, character, citizenship, service, and leadership. NJHS members volunteer their talents and time to various service opportunities; all year, they work on unique projects with the intent of servicing those around them. By emphasizing the importance of our five pillars, we encourage our members to be active and engaged, preparing them for success in high school and beyond.<br><br>NJHS is committed to improving the community at our school. Through our service projects, we hope to have an impact on our school as well as our broader community here in Irvine.</div>
