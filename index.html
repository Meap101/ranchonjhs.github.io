            <div class="index-section1-text">Rancho San Joaquin Middle School’s NJHS program was proudly established in the 2021-22 school year. Each year, we select eighth grade students that display the pillars of NJHS: Scholarship, character, citizenship, service, and leadership. NJHS members volunteer their talents and time to various service opportunities; all year, they work on unique projects with the intent of servicing those around them. By emphasizing the importance of our five pillars, we encourage our members to be active and engaged, preparing them for success in high school and beyond.<br><br>NJHS is committed to improving the community at our school. Through our service projects, we hope to have an impact on our school as well as our broader community here in Irvine.</div>

            <div class="index-section2-text">Human companionship, Flareon is objectively the most huggable Pokémon? While their maximum temperature is likely too much for most, they are capable of controlling it, so they can set themselves to the perfect temperature for you. Along with that, they have a lot of fluff, making them undeniably incredibly soft to touch. But that's not all, they have a very respectable special defense stat of 110, which means that they are likely very calm and resistant to emotional damage. Because of this, if you have a bad day, you can vent to it while hugging it, and it won't mind. It can make itself even more endearing with moves like Charm and Baby Doll Eyes, ensuring that you never have a prolonged bout of depression ever again.<br><br>I spent so much time on this website it's not even funny and I have to write documentation for next year's group too so they can repurpose the website easily and it's going to be so painful I know the website looks bad but it took so long to do and if you don't like the colors we can change them later but right now all I care about is CSS yeah let's go CSS I love CSS it's so cool CSS is the best form of styling even better than SASS and we can also make the font bigger and stuff later we can also add more fields later so we can worry about the finer details later but for now everyone be proud of me that I finished the website please I need the validation</div>
