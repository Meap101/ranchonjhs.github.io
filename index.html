I will probably make Chenyue write the rest of this paragraph because this is obviously just a placeholder. Porygon2 was created by humans using the power of science. The man-made Pokémon has been endowed with artificial intelligence that enables it to learn new gestures and emotions on its own. Further research enhanced its abilities. Sometimes, it may exhibit motions that were not programmed. This upgraded version of Porygon is designed for space exploration. However, it can't even fly.<br><br>Rotom's body is composed of plasma. It is known to infiltrate electronic devices and wreak havoc. Its electric-like body can enter some kinds of machines and take control in order to make mischief. Research continues on this Pokémon, which could be the power source of a unique motor.

            <div class="index-section2-text">Human companionship, Flareon is objectively the most huggable Pokémon? While their maximum temperature is likely too much for most, they are capable of controlling it, so they can set themselves to the perfect temperature for you. Along with that, they have a lot of fluff, making them undeniably incredibly soft to touch. But that's not all, they have a very respectable special defense stat of 110, which means that they are likely very calm and resistant to emotional damage. Because of this, if you have a bad day, you can vent to it while hugging it, and it won't mind. It can make itself even more endearing with moves like Charm and Baby Doll Eyes, ensuring that you never have a prolonged bout of depression ever again.<br><br>I spent so much time on this website it's not even funny and I have to write documentation for next year's group too so they can repurpose the website easily and it's going to be so painful I know the website looks bad but it took so long to do and if you don't like the colors we can change them later but right now all I care about is CSS yeah let's go CSS I love CSS it's so cool CSS is the best form of styling even better than SASS and we can also make the font bigger and stuff later we can also add more fields later so we can worry about the finer details later but for now everyone be proud of me that I finished the website please I need the validation</div>
