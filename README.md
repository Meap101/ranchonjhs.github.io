epic gaming njhs website made by me

steps to customize website:
- change the file in assets/group-bg to your group photo
- in assets/styles.css change the .group-photo padding to be (image height / image width x container width) (your container width is probably 100). make the first value a third of the result and the second value 2 thirds of the result (or any other ratio, as long as they add up to 1)
- in members.html, change your member list to reflect your own club
