epic gaming njhs website made by me

steps to customize website:
- change the file in assets/group-bg to your front page photo
  - in assets/styles.css change the .group-photo padding to be (image height / image width x container width) (your container width is probably 100).
- in members.html, change your member list to reflect your own club with your own images and bios (image files can be located in the assets/members folder)
  - images are scaled to 250px. make sure these images are square (don't worry about making them circular, that's handled by the code)
- also in the assets folder, change the images on the front page to your own members.
- you can adjust the size of these images by adjusting the values for index-img in styles.css
- in calender.html change the calender widget to your google calender

in case you want to edit the website, the ranchonjhs gmail account has access to all the google assests (namely scripts)
