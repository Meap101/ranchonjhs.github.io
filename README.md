epic gaming njhs website made by me

steps to customize website:
- change the file in assets/group-bg to your front page photo
  - in assets/styles.css change the .group-photo padding to be (image height / image width x container width) (your container width is probably 100).
- in members.html, change your member list to reflect your own club with your own images and bios (image files can be located in the assets/members folder)
  - images are scaled to 250px. make sure these images are square (don't worry about making them circular, that's handled by the code)
- also in the assets folder, change the images on the front page to your own members.
- you can adjust the size of these images by adjusting the values for index-img in styles.css
- in calender.html change the calender widget to your google calender

to add/remove service projects:

- edit the text blurbs in index.html to update the front page. also make sure to appropriately update the images in the assetes folder
- in the google drive folder named "Photos" (which the ranchonjhs gmail account has access to. ask mrs hartmann for credentials)
- in the folder named projects, clone one of the existing html files and rename it to the link of your new project. Be sure to appropriately hcange the description and idk do something with google scripts?? tim pls help

in case you want to edit the website, the ranchonjhs gmail account has access to all the google assests (namely scripts)

if the domain stops working, remind mrs. hartmann to go to porkbun.com and renew the subscription
