                    <b>What are the 5 pillars of NJHS?</b>
                    <br>
                    NJHS is built upon the 5 pillars of character, scholarship, leadership, service, and citizenship- both at school and in our community.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>How is NJHS related to Rancho ASB?</b>
                    <br>
                    NJHS is an organization completely separate from Rancho ASB. However, we work closely with ASB to plan on-campus events in order to prevent conflicting schedules. Our main distinguishing factor from ASB is that we commit ourselves to service projects both on and off-campus in order to benefit the community rather than just the school.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Who can apply to Rancho NJHS? When can I apply?</b>
                    <br>
                    8th graders at Rancho San Joaquin Middle School are eligible to apply to Rancho NJHS. Applications will be due Friday, September 8, 2023. Attend the Information Meeting at Lunch in Room G2 on Wednesday, August 30, 2023, for more information.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Is there a GPA requirement to apply to Rancho NJHS?</b>
                    <br>
                    Rancho NJHS applicants must have an overall 7th grade GPA of at least 3.8 (no more than 1 B grade per trimester). All applicants must print out their 7th grade Report Cards for all 3 Trimesters and submit them with the application.
